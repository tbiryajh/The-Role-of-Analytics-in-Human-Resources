# The-Role-of-Analytics-in-Human-Resources
Utilized R to analyze IBM human resources analytics dataset from Kaggle to uncover factors that contribute to employee attrition rate and provide recommendations on areas to invest in to decrease attrition rate. This analysis was submitted as a course project for Syracuse University's IST707 Data Analytics. Only code that was authored by me is included.
