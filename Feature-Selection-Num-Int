### Need to Encode the factors as integers for clustering.
####Convert Factor Types into Interger

levels(df$BusinessTravel)
df$BusinessTravel <- as.integer(df$BusinessTravel)

# 1 - Travel Rarely
# 2 - Travel frequently
# 3 - Non Travel

levels(df$Department)
df$Department <- as.integer(df$Department)

# 1 - Sales
# 2 - Research and Development
# 3 - Human Resources

levels(df$Gender)
df$Gender <- as.integer(df$Gender)
# 1 - Female
# 2 - Male

levels(df$MaritalStatus)
df$MaritalStatus <- as.integer(df$MaritalStatus)
# 1 - Single
# 2 - Married
# 3 - Divorced

levels(df$OverTime)
df$OverTime <- as.integer(df$OverTime)
# 1 - NO
# 2 - Yes

###Convert necessary integers into numericss

df$DistanceFromHome <- as.numeric(df$DistanceFromHome)
df$MonthlyIncome <- as.numeric(df$MonthlyIncome)
df$PercentSalaryHike <- as.numeric(df$PercentSalaryHike)
df$YearsAtCompany <- as.numeric(df$YearsAtCompany)
df$YearsInCurrentRole <- as.numeric(df$YearsInCurrentRole)
df$YearsSinceLastPromotion <- as.numeric(df$YearsSinceLastPromotion)
df$YearsWithCurrManager <- as.numeric(df$YearsWithCurrManager)
